# Soccer Match Timeline

A vertical timeline creator to display events of a soccer match with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 

It's a subproject of my [club homepage](https://github.com/the-guitarman/club_homepage) project. The intension is to send all match events to all connected clients via websockets from the playing field directly and to display them as a timeline. Nice benefit: This way other imprecise messenger communication becomes useless.

## Dependencies

- jQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap (CSS)
- Underscore.js
- Moment.js with locales

## Example
